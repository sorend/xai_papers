### [Evolutionary Fuzzy Systems for Explainable Artificial Intelligence: Why, When, What for, and Where to?](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8610271)

This is a propositional paper, mostly dealing with the role of Fuzzy Rule Based Systems (FRBS) in XAI. A FRBS is per se no explainable, but they refer that using multi-objective evolutionary techniques, the system can optimized for interpretability. They define two views on interpretability:
* Understandability: We are able to understand how the algorithm works (makes its inference)
* Comprehensibility: We are able to understand the model.
FRBS is argued to complement both views.
